These items have been given profiles at an item level.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Century Company published periodicals and books. It was founded in New York City in 1881. Century's primary publication was The Century Illustrated Monthly Magazine, which was regarded as the best general periodical of its time during the 1880s and 1890s. The records consist of correspondence, manuscripts, vouchers, proofs of articles, and other materials concerning the publications of the Century Company. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe General Correspondences are presumed to be unpublished by the Rights dept. Given the amount of items in the MMS container, this determination cannot be made at the item level at this time. As unpublished correspondences, it is needed to determine if authors of material died in the US over 70 years ago. Research would also be needed to determine if material created under the Century Co. is owned by the Company or individual authors. 1923-1931 material would need confirmation of publication status. Below is the approved rights designation, determined by the Rights dept.:\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this time all correspondences created before 1896 are designated PPD\\u003E120 (all uses). If no author death date is determined and the item is created between 1896 and 1922 it will be designated as UND/NFI (Unpublished) (non-commercial uses) until more information can be ascertained. If it has been determined that an author died before 1945 (less than 70 years ago) than UND/NFI (Unpublished) (non commercial uses) (or PD/ADD if publication status is verified) may be added at an item level. Authors who died after 1945 (over 70 years ago) will be given a UND/NFI (Unpublished) distinction (on-site use only).
